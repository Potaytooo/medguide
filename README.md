# medguide
"medguide" is a hybrid mobile application created with Ionic and Angular frameworks. The main objective of this application is to provide something simple yet efficient for users to perform medical records management. Within the application itself, it involves necessary CRUD functions such as adding medications details, looking at existing medication entries, modifying or updating medication details, and deleting items that are not required. Firebase Firestore is where all the data are being stored in, allowing the application to function in real time and maintain synchronisation across the entire application which is crucial for making sure everything is up to date.

One of the key focus of this project is ensuring that the application is able to respond smoothly, even with unstable internet connection which is why there is a local caching mechanism developed within the application. Every time the medication list is retrieved from Firestore, the relevant data are saved into the device’s local storage as well. Whenever the user fires up the application, it will display the cached version instantly first which helps the interface feel more responsive. When an internet connection is available, the application will refresh automatically with the latest online data. With such approach, it creates a more reliable experience along with demonstration of online and offline data handling.

To launch this application locally, the user is required to install the required dependencies by running the "npm install" command after downloading the repository. Take note that the actual Firebase credentials are not included in the repository due to security protection reasons, where an example environment file is provided instead in order to showcase the correct structure. Right before launching the application, the user must create their own "environment.ts" file with the example as a reference and input their personal Firebase configuration. Once done, the application can be launched by using the ionic serve command.

The structure of the application aligns with how the standard layout of both Ionic and Angular project are. The src/app directory contains the main pages, services, and components, while configuration files such as "angular.json", ionic.config.json", and "capacitor.config.ts" are kept within the root level. Furhtermore, the CRUD and caching logic is handled with a service file that communicates with Firestore which also manages the local storage. User interface interactions like notifications and forms are integrated with the help of Ionic components which helps with creating a good looking design.

Certain folders like "node_modules", "www", and specific platform build directories are purposely excluded from the repository because they are generated automatically hence not required to be uploaded. In short, only the essential source files and configuration documents are included in order to maintain the repository organised and easily accessible.
